    <p id="web-security-answer">In order to protect a website from web security attacks you should: 
        <ul>
            <li>Sanitize the website's code in order to remove unsafe content before presenting them to the user</li>
            <br>
            <li>Secure authorization and authentication by ensuring that they are hard to crack. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Use well-known third-party application that is tested and trusted</li>
            <br>
            <li>Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration which catches oversights from developers and helps maintain the reliability of the changes coming to a codebase.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Use well known and trusted network and hosting platforms</li>
            <br>
            <li>Implement automatic user timeout to protect users who have left their credentials hanging in the browser for a long time. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Check for potential security threats on websites like <a href="https://pentest-tools.com/website-vulnerability-scanning/website-scanner">this</a> </li>
